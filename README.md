### Project Overview
The RGIPT Campus Management Helpdesk is a web-based application designed to streamline institute operations, such as managing classes and facilitating communication among students, faculty, and administrators. It’s built using the MERN stack, which is common for web applications, ensuring a robust and scalable system.

#### Features
The application supports three user roles: Admin, Faculty, and Student, each with distinct functionalities:
- **Admin Dashboard:** Allows adding new students and teachers, creating classes and subjects, managing user accounts, and overseeing system settings.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Enables teachers to mark attendance, designate students as present or absent, and generate reports for record-keeping.
- **Performance Assessment:** Teachers can provide marks and feedback for assignments and exams, while students can view their marks and track academic progress.
- **Communication:** Facilitates messaging between teachers and students, promoting collaboration and support.


#### Installation and Usage
To set up, you’ll need to install dependencies for both the backend and frontend, configure a MongoDB connection, and run the servers. The backend starts with `npm start` in its directory, while the frontend uses `npm start` for a React development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Project Description and Purpose
The RGIPT Campus Management Helpdesk is described as a web-based application built using the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Its primary purpose is to streamline institute management, organize classes, and facilitate communication between students, faculty, and administrators. This aligns with typical campus management systems, which aim to centralize administrative tasks and enhance interaction within educational institutions.

#### Features and Functionality
The application supports three user roles: Admin, Faculty, and Student, each with distinct functionalities:
- **Admin Dashboard:** Allows adding new students and teachers, creating classes and subjects, managing user accounts, and overseeing system settings.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Teachers can take attendance, mark present/absent, and generate reports for record-keeping.
- **Performance Assessment:** Teachers provide marks and feedback, students view marks and track progress.
- **Communication:** Facilitates messaging between teachers and students, promoting collaboration and support.


#### Technical Stack and Dependencies
The project is divided into backend and frontend components, each with specific technologies:
- **Backend:** Utilizes Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic, with Mongoose for MongoDB interactions. Key dependencies include:
  - Bcrypt for password hashing
  - Cors for cross-origin resource sharing
  - Dotenv for environment variable management
  - The backend package.json indicates an ISC license, which may apply to this component.
- **Frontend:** Built with React.js, incorporating Material-UI for styling, Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation. Notable dependencies include:
  - Axios for HTTP requests
  - Recharts for data visualization
  - The frontend is configured for development with scripts like `npm start` and `npm build`.


#### Project Structure
Based on common MERN stack practices and the information gathered, the project likely follows this structure:
- **`backend/`**: Contains server-side code, including:
  - `models/`: Mongoose schemas for database entities (e.g., User, Student, Teacher).
  - `routes/`: Express routes for API endpoints.
  - `controllers/`: Logic for handling requests.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the backend server.
- **`frontend/`**: Houses the client-side application, with:
  - `src/`: Contains React components, pages, and utilities.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI elements.
  - `pages/`: Route-specific pages (e.g., dashboard, attendance).
  - `redux/`: Store, actions, and reducers for state management.
  - `App.js`: Main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.

This structure is inferred from typical MERN stack projects, though exact folder names may vary.

#### Installation Process
To set up the project, follow these steps:

##### Backend Installation
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with necessary environment variables, such as:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```
   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string. Additional variables may be required based on the code, such as port numbers or API keys.
4. Start the server using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This uses nodemon, as indicated by the backend package.json scripts, for automatic server restarts during development.

##### Frontend Installation
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This typically launches the application at `http://localhost:3000`, though the exact port may depend on configuration.

#### Usage Guide
Once both servers are running:
1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by the frontend).
2. Log in with credentials corresponding to your user role (Admin, Faculty, or Student). The system likely includes a registration or initial setup process for creating user accounts.
3. Use the dashboard and features based on your role:
   - **Admins** can manage user accounts, create classes, and configure system settings.
   - **Faculty** can take attendance, enter marks, provide feedback, and communicate with students.
   - **Students** can view their attendance records, academic performance, and send messages to faculty.


#### Contribution Guidelines
To contribute to the project:
1. Fork the repository on GitHub to create your own copy.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, using a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/attendance-tracking`).
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages (e.g., “Add attendance report generation feature”).
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository, detailing your changes and any relevant context.

This process follows standard open-source contribution practices, ensuring maintainability and collaboration.
